# RustRayTracer2

A simple rust ray tracer... It is more powerfull than my previous one yet slower (as a result I am trying to implement multi threading). When I can render a simple image in under an hour I will do so an Put it here as a reference.

TODO:
  - make bitmap textures or similar work 
  - implement cylinders and curves
  - implement texture functions
  - implemet multi-threading
  - clean up code
  - implement depth of field
  
 all contributions are welcome
